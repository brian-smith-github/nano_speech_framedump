This just sets up a 6400 times/sec interrupt.
On reciving an interrupt it reads the ADC and writes the (preemph/delta) data
as 8-bits down the serial bus.
The serial_read/ code can read this and convert it to RAW audio which 
the 'sox' app can convert to regular WAV format to listen back to.

(the audio quality with my current simple setup is currently arocious,
I can barely get Whisper to properly transcribe it!)
